             <h1>The Journey to a bachelor’s degree: Overcoming Challenges and Staying Mentally Healthy
             </h1>

             <p>Choosing the right college is a pivotal decision in a student's life, one that shapes their academic and professional journey. In a recent interview, we had the opportunity to learn from an individual who made a significant choice to pursue their college education. The interviewee, who completed their bachelor’s degree in information technology, shared their motivations and experiences. In this article, we will explore their journey, the drive that led to their accomplishment, and how they managed stress to maintain their mental health.
             </p>

             <h1>Choosing the Right Path
             </h1>

            <p>When asked why they chose their college for their bachelor's degree, the interviewee explained that it was an easy decision. The college they attended, STI Sta. Maria in Bulacan, was the first in the region to offer a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). Being part of the inaugural batch was an exciting opportunity, and it influenced their choice significantly. This pioneering spirit was a driving force behind their college selection.
            </p>

            <h1>The Drive to Accomplish
            </h1>


            <p>The path to a bachelor's degree was not always straightforward for our interviewee. Before embarking on this journey, they had already completed a 2-year associate degree in computer technology. While this provided them with valuable experience, they realized that a four-year bachelor's degree held distinct advantages in the job market. Their decision to return to college and complete their bachelor's degree was driven by the need for a stronger competitive edge in their career. It was a journey marked by determination and a desire for better career opportunities.
            </p>

            <h1>Managing Stress and Maintaining Mental Health
            </h1>

            <p>College life often comes with its fair share of stress. When asked about their strategies for coping with stress, the interviewee shared valuable insights. They emphasized the importance of time management, acknowledging that effective planning and organization were crucial for managing academic and personal responsibilities. Additionally, they highlighted the significance of one's social circle, suggesting that the people around you can significantly impact your decisions and overall well-being.
            Another crucial aspect they brought into the conversation was spirituality. The interviewee stressed the importance of having spiritual guidance to manage stress. Whether through faith, meditation, or other spiritual practices, they argued that connecting with a higher power can be a source of strength and resilience during challenging times.

            <h1>Balancing College and Work: A Working Student's Perspective
            </h1>

            <p>Balancing the demands of college life with a part-time job can be a daunting task. We had the privilege of speaking with an individual who navigated this challenging journey. This interviewee, a working student, shared their experiences, offering valuable insights into time management, academic success, exam preparation, and the art of providing constructive feedback to peers.
            </p>

            <h1>Balancing College and Personal Life
            </h1>

            <p>For our interviewee, college life was not just about attending classes and studying; it also involved juggling a part-time job. When asked how they balanced college and personal life, they stressed the significance of time management. Their schedule often involved transitioning from work to school and vice versa. Yet, they found a way to enjoy the process and ensure that they stayed happy. Knowing one's priorities was critical. As exam time neared, it was crucial to manage time effectively to excel academically while still fulfilling work responsibilities. The interviewee demonstrated that it was possible to find joy in the journey of balancing college and work life.
